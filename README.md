# Airlines-Customer-Satisfaction-KNN-Analysis
+ In this report, a thorough analysis of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier algorithm has been done on the "Airlines Customer satisfaction" dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
+ [Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sjleshrac/airlines-customer-satisfaction)
+ The KNN algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
+ In-depth data pre-processing and analysis also has been done to gain insights on the data.
+ The model's working has been clearly explained, along with its hyperparameters.
+ Observations were made on how the model's performance varied with the change in hyperparameters and the amount of training data used.
+ Performance of the model increased with the increase in training data and hyperparameter tuning.
